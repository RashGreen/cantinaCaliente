  <!--Here I am going to create containers to house a reservation list, a button to link to a page where the client can make a reservation form,
    we also will need a container to house the waiting list-->  
    <!--I'll make a banner to house the name of the app as well as the buttons to link to the other two pages.
    @the foot of the page there will be links to clear the table as well as view the waitlist and tables in JSON format. -->
